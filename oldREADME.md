# Nixvim Dev-shell Environment

This is a Nix flake configuration for Neovim built with the [Nixvim project](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim)
It is fully configured with LSPs, linters, formatters, debuggers, styling, and
popular navigation plugins.

## Setup

This flake can be built with the Nix package manager or with a NixOS system
configured with flake support. [Follow these instructions](https://nixos.org/download#download-nix)
to download and install the Nix package manager for your system.

Once you have the package manager installed, enable flak support by adding
the following line to ~/.config/nix/nix.conf or /etc/nix/nix.conf:

```
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

You will need to restart your shell or terminal session for the setting to take effect.

### Dev-shell

To use Neovim from the dev-shell, clone this repo with:

```
git clone https://github.com/pete3n/nixvim-flake.git
```

cd to the repo and enter the dev-shell environment with:

```
nix develop
```

or run it directly from Github with:

```
nix develop github:pete3n/nixvim-flake
```

You can create a persistent profile link for the development environment with:

```
nix develop --profile ./nixvim
```

"nixvim" is an arbitrary name. Use whatever name you like. This will create a
symlink to the Nix store environment derivation. You can re-open the profile with:

```
nix develop ./nixvim
```

## Styling

- Theme is [Tokyo Night](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) with
  [noice](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim) UI from [@folke](https://github.com/folke)
- [lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) with onedark theme

\*Debugging is with a GDB/LLDB/BASHDB wrapper through [nvim-gdb](https://github.com/sakhnik/nvim-gdb)
I have been unable to get DAP working correctly for these languages.

## Thanks

Big shout out to the Nix and Neovim community for all the awesome plugins, documentation,
videos, and support. There are too many people to thank, but for this project in
particular, I'd like to thank [@vimjoyer](https://github.com/vimjoyer) for piquing
my interest in Nixvim with [his video](https://youtu.be/b641h63lqy0) and [@GaetanLepage](https://github.com/GaetanLepage)
for maintaining the Nixvim project.
